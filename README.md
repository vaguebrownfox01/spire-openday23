# Speech-Powered Ping-Pong Ball Launcher

This project uses a Raspberry Pi, a microphone, and a fan to create a game where participants have to speak as fast as they can in order to blow a ping-pong ball out of a narrow tube.

The Raspberry Pi runs a Python script that records the participant's speech and determines the rate of speech. The faster the speech, the faster the fan rotates, and the more likely the ball is to be blown out of the tube.

The project is controlled by a Python script that runs on the Raspberry Pi. The script is available on GitHub.
